Audio Analysis/Matching project

How it works:

1. Audio files are converted into spectrograms
2. These spectrograms are used to identify local maximas
3. These maximas are used to generate a hash for the audio file
4. These hashes are compared to identify audio from the same event

dependencies:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Noisereduce
- Pil (for Image)
- Hashlib
- Scipy
